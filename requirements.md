# Full Stack Project

## Description
* Your task is to build something awesome
* You'll be using the back-end (and front-end) skills you've developed over the last couple of months

## Technical Requirements: front-end
* Do not spent a lot of time on CSS - please use a library (ie. Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation, Materialize) for your styling
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
  * [Foundation](https://get.foundation/)
  * [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* Implement a simple Responsive Web Design that works on Chrome in macOS, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide

## Technical Requirements: back-end
* Use Express for your HTTP framework
* Use a view engine for your templating
* Use PostgreSQL for your database
  * Create at least 3 tables, with Model classes as is appropriate
  * Make sure that at least 2 of the tables are related (via foreign keys)

## Recommended
* Use Sequelize to create Models and Migrations
* Allow user login, with passwords encrypted with bcrypt

## Optionally
* Use only API routes that return JSON data (store your static files in the 'public' folder)
  * If you choose this option, the view engine requirement isn't necessary
* Incorporate data from an external API
* Deploy your application to Heroku
* Implement OAuth with Passport.js

## Workflow Requirements
* Create GitHub repo (add all group members as collaborators)
